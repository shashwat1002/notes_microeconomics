# Models

## income threshold model
- people with income below a certain threshold won't buy a consumer durable such as a refrigerator or a car.
- People with income above said threshold will almost certainly will

Both the statements together imply that the pruchases of products like refrigerators or cars are expected to grow dramatically over-night if average income crosses threshold. 

Validations for this model have indeed been observed in the world

To loosely define a durable good: __goods not for immediate consumption and able to be kept for a period of time__

### Assumptions for said model
- We assume that factors other than income are not relevant to decision making. Things like color of the car.
